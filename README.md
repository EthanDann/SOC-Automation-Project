# SOC-Automation-Project

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with a SOC Analystâ€™s tools, including writing better documentation! The project will take me from design to start (from scratch) and then to a fully functional lab with responsive capabilities and case management.

## Components Used

- **Wazuh**: Wazuh is used as the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and XDR (Extended Detection and Response) platform. It provides real-time monitoring, threat detection, and response capabilities for security incidents.

- **TheHive**: TheHive is utilized for case management. It serves as a centralized platform for incident response, allowing SOC analysts to create, manage, and track alerts and investigations efficiently.

- **Shuffle**: Shuffle is employed for SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) capabilities. It enables the automation of repetitive tasks, orchestration of security workflows, and integration with various security tools and systems.

## Documentation

I will be documenting the entire project to improve my documentation skills and gain a better understanding of each day's work. I will do my best to provide accurate descriptions of each day, implementation steps, challenges faced and lessons learned throughout the project.
